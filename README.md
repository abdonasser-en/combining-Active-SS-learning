The "Combining Active and Semi-Supervised Learning" project explores an innovative approach to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This intelligent fusion of two distinct learning methods aims to harness the potential of partially labeled data while leveraging the benefits of proactive sample selection.


## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to push the boundaries of machine learning model performance in situations of insufficiently labeled data. By combining active learning and semi-supervised learning, our approach aims to optimize the gathering of relevant information while making the most of available unlabeled data.

## Key Features

- **Active Sample Selection:** Active learning proactively identifies samples with the greatest potential to enhance model performance. This reduces the need for manually labeling a large number of samples.

- **Utilization of Unlabeled Data:** Semi-supervised learning employs unlabeled data to enhance the model's robustness. This additional data allows the model to gain a better understanding of underlying patterns and features.

- **Resource Optimization:** The combination of both approaches aims to maximize model performance while minimizing the resources required for manual data annotation.
